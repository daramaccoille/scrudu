# Scrudu React App

This project is a React application scaffolded with Vite. It will replicate the functionality of the original `prototype.html`, loading questions from `Scruduithe.tsv` and displaying images from the `scruduithe_images` folder. Tailwind CSS will be used for styling.

## Development

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
- Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view the app.

## Deployment

This app is ready for deployment to Netlify or other static hosting providers. Ensure that `Scruduithe.tsv` and `scruduithe_images` are included in the published output.

## Next Steps

- Migrate logic from `prototype.html` to React components in `src/`.
- Integrate Tailwind CSS.
- Implement TSV loading and image display.
